Welcome to the E4MF Project! 

What is it? 

E4MF is an implementation of an EMF Editor on Eclipse e4 Platform. 


Why is it? 

Someone at the recent Eclipse con forum asked, will an EMF Editor 
work in e4? The answer is yes, using the 3.x compatibility layer. 
I wanted to learn e4, and decided it would be fun to create e4mf 

Perhaps cool if some of this works ends-up in the official releases of 
EMF. 


How this work? 

Clone the repo, and imported into your Eclipse (4.3) IDE Workspace. 
Open the file: 


[TODO] name of .product


- Check the product dependencies. 
- Launch the product


This will open the E4mf editor. 



Have fun!
